# Afrobarometer Language Mappings

This contains data on mappings between languages used in the [Afrobarometer](http://www.afrobarometer.org/) survey and common language databases: [ISO 639-3](http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/)/[Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/) and [WALS](http://wals.info/languoid).

Currently only languages for Afrobarometer Round 6 (2016) have been mapped.

# Data

The data consist of several comma-separated tables in the `data` directory.

# Build

The outpu data is checked into the repo and contained in `data/`, so there should be no need to rebuild the data to use it.

To re-build the dataset:
```
$ build.sh
```
